            Although I managed to give you a list of reasons why I love you, you know that I'm not great with words lol. That's why I've compiled a <a href=https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3wotaM9ZISevQ0yLsfDuO3?si=0119913f4dc641c2><em>list of songs</em></a> that capture exactly how I feel towards you. Enjoy!
